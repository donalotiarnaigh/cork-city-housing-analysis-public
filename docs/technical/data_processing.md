# Cork City Property Analysis - Data Processing Documentation

This document describes the data processing workflow used in the Cork City Property Analysis project. The project processes two main data sources: the Property Price Register (PPR) data and Airbnb listings data for Cork City, Ireland.

## Data Processing Scripts

The data processing workflow consists of a series of R scripts that transform raw data into the final datasets used by the Shiny application. Each script is designed to perform a specific task in the data preparation pipeline.

      - Removes properties that cannot be accurately geocoded
      - Updates coordinates based on manual corrections

11. **11_standardize_property_types.R**
    - Purpose: Standardizes property type descriptions
    - Key operations:
      - Normalizes property type categories
      - Groups similar property types
      - Creates a consistent property type taxonomy

## Data Processing Workflow

The workflow follows these general steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Initial preparation of raw data sources
2. **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources
3. **Geocoding**: Adding spatial coordinates to property records
4. **Spatial Processing**: Analyzing geographic patterns and relationships
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Generating metrics and summaries
6. **Final Preparation**: Creating the final datasets used by the Shiny app

The processed data is saved in GPKG (GeoPackage) format, which efficiently stores both spatial and attribute data, and is loaded by the Shiny application for visualization and analysis.
