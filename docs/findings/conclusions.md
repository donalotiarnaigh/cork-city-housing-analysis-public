# Cork City Property Analysis - Conclusions

## Executive Summary

This document presents the consolidated findings and conclusions from our comprehensive analysis of property sales and Airbnb listings in Cork City, Ireland. By examining geographic distributions, price patterns, and spatial relationships, we have uncovered significant insights into Cork City's housing market dynamics and the interplay between residential property sales and short-term rentals.

## Key Findings

### 1. Distinct Spatial Patterns

Our geographic analysis revealed clear differences in the spatial distribution of property sales versus Airbnb listings:

- **Property Sales Distribution**: Property sales are broadly distributed across Cork City with multiple clusters in established residential areas like Douglas/Rochestown (south), Blackpool/Mayfield (north), and parts of the City Center.

- **Airbnb Concentration**: Airbnb listings show a more centralized pattern, with strong concentrations in the City Center, particularly around University College Cork, tourist-oriented districts, and waterfront areas along the River Lee.

- **Cluster Analysis**: Property sales form multiple distinct clusters throughout the city, while Airbnb listings demonstrate more concentrated clustering with very high density in tourist areas and significantly lower presence in many residential suburbs.

### 2. Price Characteristics

The price statistics analysis highlighted significant differences in the pricing structure of both markets:

- **Price Ranges**:
  - Property sales span from €6,246 to €3,261,094 with a median of €335,000
  - Airbnb listings range from €35 to €1,000 per night with a median of €105

- **Market Segmentation**:
  - 57.7% of property sales fall between €200,000 and €400,000
  - Nearly half (47.9%) of Airbnb listings are priced under €100 per night
  - New properties command a 9.5% premium over second-hand properties
  - Entire home Airbnb listings are priced 149% higher than private rooms

- **Distribution Characteristics**: Both markets show positively skewed distributions with significant high-end outliers, indicating the presence of luxury segments in both markets.

### 3. Spatial Price Dynamics

The spatial price analysis revealed complex geographic price patterns:

- **Multi-nodal Property Prices**: Property price density does not follow a simple distance-from-city-center gradient but instead forms several distinct "hot zones" influenced by neighborhood characteristics.

- **Centralized Airbnb Prices**: Airbnb price density shows a more centralized pattern with clear distance decay as one moves away from the city center and tourist attractions.

- **Price Hotspots**:
  - Property price hotspots are located in Douglas, Blackrock, Montenotte, and select parts of the city center
  - Airbnb price hotspots concentrate in the central business district, historic core, and areas with high tourist footfall

- **Negative Spatial Correlation**: A negative correlation coefficient of -0.275 between property and Airbnb price hotspots indicates that areas with high property values often don't correspond to areas with high Airbnb rates, and vice versa.

## Implications

### Market Dynamics

1. **Different Value Propositions**: The negative correlation between property and Airbnb price hotspots suggests different value drivers in each market. Long-term residential value is influenced by neighborhood prestige, schools, and residential amenities, while short-term rental value is driven by proximity to tourist attractions, nightlife, and city center access.

2. **Investment Opportunities**: Areas with lower property purchase prices but higher Airbnb rates may represent potential investment opportunities for property investors looking to enter the short-term rental market.

3. **Affordability Concerns**: With a median property price of €335,000 (approximately 8.4 times the average Irish annual salary), housing affordability remains a significant concern in Cork City.

### Urban Planning and Policy

1. **Regulatory Considerations**: The concentration of Airbnb listings in certain areas, particularly the city center, may warrant targeted regulation to preserve long-term housing availability in these areas.

2. **Infrastructure Planning**: The polycentric nature of Cork City's property market suggests that infrastructure and services should be planned with multiple nodes in mind, rather than assuming a single central core.

3. **Housing Development Strategy**: New housing developments might be more successful if aligned with the identified residential hotspots and emerging areas of demand, rather than focusing solely on proximity to the city center.

### Social and Economic Impact

1. **Neighborhood Evolution**: Areas with high Airbnb concentrations but more moderate property prices may be experiencing transformation from primarily residential to more tourism-oriented neighborhoods.

2. **Economic Opportunities**: The clear segmentation of both markets suggests opportunities for targeted services catering to different property market participants (homebuyers vs. short-term visitors).

3. **Community Dynamics**: High concentrations of Airbnb listings in specific areas may affect community cohesion and local service provision in these neighborhoods.

## Future Research Opportunities

### Data Enhancements

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporate time-series data to track changes in both markets over multiple years, potentially revealing emerging trends and seasonal patterns.

2. **Additional Variables**: Include data on property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) and neighborhood characteristics (crime rates, school ratings, walkability scores) to deepen the analysis.

3. **Occupancy Rates**: Obtain Airbnb occupancy data to calculate actual rental income rather than just listed prices, providing a more accurate comparison with property investment returns.

### Methodological Extensions

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict property prices and Airbnb rates based on location and property characteristics.

2. **Network Analysis**: Analyze transportation networks and their influence on both property prices and Airbnb rates.

3. **Agent-Based Simulation**: Create simulations to model the potential impact of policy interventions or market changes on both the property sales and short-term rental markets.

### Application Enhancements

1. **Scenario Analysis**: Add functionality to simulate the impact of different policy interventions (e.g., Airbnb regulations, property tax changes) on both markets.

2. **Investment Calculator**: Develop a tool to help users compare potential returns from long-term property ownership versus short-term rental income.

3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Adapt the application for better mobile device usage to increase accessibility.

## Conclusion

The Cork City Property Analysis project has revealed a complex housing ecosystem with distinct patterns in both the property sales and short-term rental markets. While these markets operate in partially overlapping geographic areas, they respond to different value drivers and serve different user needs.

The negative correlation between property sales price hotspots and Airbnb price hotspots is particularly significant, suggesting that property investors and short-term rental operators may be valuing locations differently. This insight has important implications for urban planning, housing policy, and investment strategies in Cork City.

By continuing to monitor and analyze these patterns, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about housing development, regulation, and investment, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and sustainable housing market in Cork City.
