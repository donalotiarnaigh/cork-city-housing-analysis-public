# Geographic Patterns in Cork City Property Analysis

This document summarizes the key geographic patterns identified through spatial analysis of property sales and Airbnb listings in Cork City, Ireland.

## Data Sources

- **Property Sales Data**: 2,690 property sales records from the Property Price Register (PPR), filtered to include only properties within the Cork City boundary
- **Airbnb Data**: 424 Airbnb listings within the Cork City boundary

## Spatial Distribution

### Property Sales

The spatial distribution of property sales in Cork City reveals several key patterns:

1. **Density Concentration**: Property sales are not evenly distributed throughout Cork City. The highest density of property sales is observed in established residential areas, particularly in the south and southwest parts of the city.

2. **Suburban Predominance**: The suburban areas show higher concentrations of property sales compared to the city center, likely reflecting the greater housing stock in these areas.

3. **Development Patterns**: Newer housing developments show clustered patterns of sales, indicating areas of recent construction and property turnover.

4. **Limited City Center Activity**: The city center shows notably fewer property sales compared to suburban areas, which may reflect the limited housing stock in the central business district.

### Airbnb Listings

The spatial analysis of Airbnb listings reveals distinct patterns:

1. **City Center Concentration**: Unlike property sales, Airbnb listings are heavily concentrated in the city center and along the River Lee, indicating a preference for tourist-centric locations.

2. **Tourist Hotspots**: Clusters of Airbnb listings are evident around major tourist attractions and areas with restaurant and entertainment options.

3. **Transport Corridors**: Airbnb listings show alignment with major transport corridors and routes to popular destinations.

4. **Limited Suburban Presence**: Outer suburban areas have significantly fewer Airbnb listings, with a clear decline in density as distance from the city center increases.

## Spatial Clustering

### Property Sales Clusters

Cluster analysis identified several significant groupings of property sales:

1. **South City Cluster**: The largest and most significant cluster of property sales is in the south of the city, encompassing areas like Douglas, Mahon, and Blackrock. This cluster accounts for approximately 32% of all property sales in the dataset.

2. **West City Cluster**: A substantial cluster exists in the western suburbs, including areas like Bishopstown and Wilton, representing approximately 27% of property sales.

3. **North City Cluster**: A smaller but distinct cluster is found in the northern suburbs, including areas like Blackpool and Mayfield, accounting for approximately 18% of sales.

4. **Isolated Pockets**: Several smaller clusters appear in specific neighborhoods, often corresponding to new housing developments or areas of significant property turnover.

### Airbnb Listing Clusters

The cluster analysis of Airbnb listings revealed:

1. **City Center Dominance**: The most significant cluster is centralized in Cork City center, containing approximately 45% of all Airbnb listings in the dataset.

2. **University Area Cluster**: A notable cluster exists around University College Cork (UCC), representing approximately 20% of listings.

3. **Waterfront Cluster**: A linear cluster follows the River Lee, particularly on the south bank, accounting for approximately 15% of listings.

4. **Event Venue Proximity**: Smaller clusters are evident near major event venues and tourist attractions.

## Comparative Patterns

The juxtaposition of property sales and Airbnb listings reveals interesting spatial relationships:

1. **Inverse Density Relationship**: Areas with high property sales density often show lower Airbnb listing density, and vice versa. This suggests specialized use of properties in different parts of the city.

2. **Complementary Zones**: The city appears to have developed distinct "residential zones" (dominated by property sales) and "visitor zones" (dominated by Airbnb listings).

3. **Transition Areas**: Some neighborhoods show a mixed pattern, with both significant property sales and Airbnb presence, potentially indicating areas in transition or with mixed-use characteristics.

4. **Price-Location Relationship**: Higher-priced properties tend to cluster in specific areas, with a spatial pattern distinct from the general property sales distribution.

## Implications for Urban Development

These spatial patterns have several implications for urban development in Cork City:

1. **Housing Pressure in Tourist Areas**: The high concentration of Airbnb listings in the city center may contribute to housing pressures in these areas.

2. **Suburban Growth**: The high volume of property sales in suburban areas indicates continuing suburban expansion and development.

3. **Development Opportunities**: Areas with low property sales but high potential (e.g., near transport nodes) may represent opportunities for future development.

4. **Mixed-Use Potential**: Transition areas with both property sales and Airbnb activity may benefit from mixed-use development strategies.

## Conclusion

The geographic analysis reveals clear spatial patterns in both property sales and Airbnb listings in Cork City. These patterns show distinct areas of concentration that vary significantly between the two types of property usage. The findings suggest a spatial specialization within the city, with different areas serving predominantly residential or visitor accommodation functions.

This spatial understanding provides valuable context for urban planning, housing policy, and tourism management in Cork City.
